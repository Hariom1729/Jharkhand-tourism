            <p>The Chotanagpur Tenancy (CNT) Act of 1908 is one of the most significant and enduring pieces of legislation in Jharkhand's history. It was enacted by the British government in the direct aftermath of the Birsa Munda-led 'Ulgulan' (The Great Tumult), which highlighted the severe exploitation and land alienation faced by the region's tribal communities.</p>
            <p>The primary objective of the CNT Act was to protect the land rights of the Adivasis (tribal people). It imposed strict restrictions on the transfer of tribal land to non-tribals, recognizing and codifying the traditional 'Khuntkatti' system of communal land ownership. This was a landmark step to prevent the rampant land grabbing by moneylenders and zamindars that had fueled decades of unrest.</p>
            <p>Even over a century later, the CNT Act remains a cornerstone of legal protection for tribal land in Jharkhand. While it has been the subject of political debate and proposed amendments, it stands as a powerful legal legacy of the tribal struggle for 'Jal, Jangal, Jameen' (Water, Forest, Land) and continues to be a critical safeguard for indigenous identity and rights.</p>
