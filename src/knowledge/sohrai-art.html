            <p>Sohrai is a vibrant, ritualistic art form practiced predominantly by the tribal women of Jharkhand. This ancient tradition is intrinsically linked to the **Sohrai harvest festival**, celebrated annually after the monsoon season. The art is a form of thanksgiving to the deities for a bountiful harvest and serves to welcome prosperity into the home.</p>
            <p>The entire process is deeply connected to nature. The canvas for this art is the mud wall of the artists' homes, which are freshly plastered before painting. The colors are derived from natural sources: red, black, yellow, and white clays found in the local area. Artists use their fingers, broken pieces of combs, or twigs as brushes, creating bold, graphic patterns with a unique combing technique.</p>
            <p>The motifs in Sohrai art are inspired by the natural world, celebrating the symbiotic relationship between humans, animals, and the divine. You'll often see depictions of cattle, birds, elephants, and floral patterns, each with its own symbolic meaning. In recent years, this traditional art form has gained a **Geographical Indication (GI) tag**, recognizing its unique origin and helping to preserve this beautiful cultural heritage for future generations.</p>
