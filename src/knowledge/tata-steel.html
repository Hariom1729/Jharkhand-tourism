            <p>At the turn of the 20th century, the visionary industrialist Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata dreamed of building India's first fully integrated steel plant. His quest for a location rich in iron ore, coal, and water led him to the dense forests of the Chotanagpur Plateau. In 1907, his dream took root in the remote tribal village of Sakchi.</p>
            <p>The Tata Iron and Steel Company (TISCO), now known as Tata Steel, was established here, and a new city was planned around it. Designed with meticulous care, the city offered its workers modern amenities like clean water, sanitation, schools, and parks—a revolutionary concept at the time. In 1919, Lord Chelmsford, the Viceroy of India, renamed the city Jamshedpur in honor of its founder.</p>
            <p>The establishment of the steel plant was not just an industrial achievement; it was a nation-building project. It laid the foundation for India's industrial self-sufficiency and transformed the socio-economic landscape of the region, turning a quiet village into a bustling, cosmopolitan metropolis known as the "Steel City of India."</p>
