            <p>December 27, 1975, marks one of the darkest days in the history of Indian mining. At the Chasnala colliery near Dhanbad, a massive explosion tore through a coal seam deep underground. The blast was so powerful that it breached a protective barrier separating the mine from a vast, abandoned reservoir of water above it.</p>
            <p>Within minutes, millions of gallons of water and slurry rushed into the mine shafts, trapping hundreds of miners working below. The inundation was swift and catastrophic, leaving no time for escape. Rescue efforts were severely hampered by the sheer volume of water and debris that had filled the complex network of tunnels.</p>
            <p>The official death toll was recorded as 375 miners, but many believe the actual number was higher. The Chasnala disaster was a tragic wake-up call that exposed severe lapses in safety protocols within the nationalized coal industry. It led to a complete overhaul of mining regulations in India, with a renewed focus on safety, emergency preparedness, and the structural integrity of underground mines.</p>
