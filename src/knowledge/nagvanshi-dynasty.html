            <p>The history of the Chotanagpur plateau is dominated by the legacy of the Nagvanshi dynasty, one of the oldest and longest-ruling dynasties in India. According to legend, the dynasty was founded by Raja Phani Mukut Rai in the first century AD, who was chosen by the local tribal chiefs to be their king.</p>
            <p>For nearly two millennia, the Nagvanshi kings ruled over the region, maintaining a large degree of autonomy even as powerful empires like the Mughals rose and fell. They were great patrons of art, culture, and architecture, and their rule saw the construction of numerous forts and temples that stand as testaments to their long reign. Their capital shifted several times, from Sutiambe to Chutia and later to the impressive fortified capital of Doisanagar, which had a five-storied palace.</p>
            <p>Key architectural legacies of the Nagvanshis include the magnificent **Jagannath Temple** in Ranchi, built in the 17th century, and the ruins of the Navratangarh fort. Their long and continuous rule provided stability and helped shape a unique cultural identity for the region, blending tribal traditions with mainstream Hindu practices. The dynasty's influence only began to wane with the arrival of the British and the implementation of the Permanent Settlement.</p>
