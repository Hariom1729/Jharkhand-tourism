            <p>Birsa Munda is a revered figure in Indian history, a visionary tribal leader and freedom fighter who became a symbol of resistance against British colonial rule. Born in the mid-19th century, he grew up witnessing the oppressive system imposed by the British and the exploitation of his people by outside landlords and moneylenders (dikus), who were destroying the traditional tribal land system known as 'khuntkatti'.</p>
            <p>In his twenties, Birsa Munda started a powerful socio-religious movement that preached a return to tribal traditions and challenged the colonial administration. This movement soon transformed into a militant uprising known as the **Ulgulan**, or 'The Great Tumult'. He mobilized thousands of Munda tribespeople with the call for self-rule, or "Munda Raj," and used guerrilla warfare tactics to target symbols of British authority.</p>
            <p>Although the rebellion was brutally suppressed and Birsa Munda was captured and died in prison in 1900 at the young age of 25, his impact was profound. His heroic struggle forced the British to enact the **Chotanagpur Tenancy Act of 1908**, which protected tribal land from being taken by outsiders. Today, he is revered as "Dharti Aba" (Father of the Earth), and his birthday, November 15th, is celebrated as Jharkhand Foundation Day.</p>
