            <p>The history of Jharkhand is deeply intertwined with its rich mineral wealth, particularly iron ore. This history dates back over two millennia, to an ancient tribal community known as the Asuras. Mentioned in ancient Hindu texts like the Rigveda, the Asuras of the Chotanagpur plateau are believed to be among the earliest iron smelters in India.</p>
            <p>Archaeological sites scattered across districts like Gumla and Lohardaga have unearthed ancient furnaces, iron slag, and various iron artifacts. These findings suggest that the Asuras possessed a sophisticated and advanced understanding of metallurgy for their time. They developed unique, indigenous techniques to extract high-quality iron from the local ore, a craft that was passed down through generations.</p>
            <p>The legacy of the Asuras highlights the deep historical connection between the people of Jharkhand and the land's natural resources. They were not just inhabitants of a mineral-rich region; they were pioneers of a technology that would become central to the development of civilizations. Today, the small Asura community in Jharkhand is recognized as a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group, carrying with them a profound metallurgical heritage.</p>
