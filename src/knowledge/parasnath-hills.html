            <p>Rising majestically from the plains of Giridih district, Parasnath Hill, also known as Shikharji, is the highest mountain in Jharkhand and the most sacred pilgrimage destination for Jains worldwide. Its name, meaning "Venerable Peak," reflects its immense spiritual significance in Jainism.</p>
            <p>According to Jain tradition, this is the holy site where 20 of the 24 Tirthankaras (spiritual teachers), along with countless other monks, attained moksha or salvation. The hill is dotted with numerous temples, or "Tonks," each dedicated to one of the Tirthankaras who achieved enlightenment there. The most revered of these is the temple dedicated to the 23rd Tirthankara, Parshvanatha, after whom the hill is named.</p>
            <p>For centuries, pilgrims have undertaken the arduous trek to the summit, a journey of faith that covers 27 kilometers. The serene atmosphere and the profound history make Shikharji not just a religious site but a place of deep spiritual tranquility and historical importance.</p>
