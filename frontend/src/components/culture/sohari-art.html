              Sarhul is distinguished during the spring season and Saal trees obtain new flowers on their branches. It is a reverence of the village god who is regarded to be the guardian of the clan. People dance and sing when the fresh flowers come out. The Gods are worshiped with the Saal flowers. The Pahan or priest of village fasts for some days. In dawn, the priests take bath and puts on dhoti made of kachha dhaga (virgin cotton).

              The preceding dusk, the priests take 3 new earthen pots and fill them with water; the subsequent morning they observe these earthen pots and water level within. If the level of water decreases they predict that there would be less rain or famine and if the level of water is average, that is an indication of a good rain.
            </p> <p>Before the pooja initiates, the Preist’s wife washes his feet and seeks blessings from the priest. During the pooja, people envelop the Sarna place. Dhol, Turhi and Nagara players keep playing along with Priests chanting prayers. The festival goes on for weeks in the region of Chhotanagpur. In the region of Kolhan, the festival is called "Baa Porob" that means Flower Festival.</p>
