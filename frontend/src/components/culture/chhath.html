             Chhath Pooja is a primeval Hindu festival and Vedic Festival committed to Surya (Sun God), also acknowledged as Surya Shashti. The Chhath Puja is implemented so as to show gratitude towards God Surya for supporting life on earth and to appeal to the yielding of certain wishes. The Sun, well thought-out to be the god of life - force, and energy, is adulated during the festival of Chhath to prop up well-being, affluence, and development.</p>
              <p>The subsequent day is full of primal sports of gallantry. The devotees penetrate hooks on the skin & get tied at 1 end of a stretched parallel wooden pole. The other part of the pole which is linked with the rope towed around the posted exhibit the breathtaking dance. This festival is all the rage in Tamar, Jharkhand.
