              This festival is the worship of Karam devta (God of power as well as youthfulness). Karam festival is held on the 11th of moon in the month of Bhadra. Factions of villagers go to the jungle and accumulate wood, flowers and fruits. These are requisite during the Puja of God Karam. During this period, people dance and sing in groups. The complete valley seems to be boogieing with the drum beat. This festival is distinguished by Baiga, Oraon, Majhwar and Binjhwari tribes of Jharkhand
