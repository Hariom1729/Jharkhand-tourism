            <p>The movement for a separate Jharkhand state was a long and complex struggle, but it gained its most significant political momentum with the formation of the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) on February 4, 1973. The party was founded in Dhanbad by tribal leader Shibu Soren and Marxist trade unionist A. K. Roy, along with writer Binod Bihari Mahato, uniting tribal and non-tribal working-class interests under a single banner.</p>
            <p>The JMM's primary agenda was to fight for the rights of the indigenous people and the working class against exploitation by moneylenders, mining mafias, and apathetic government policies. It galvanized the masses with its powerful call for 'Jharkhand alag prant' (a separate Jharkhand province), arguing that a separate state was the only way to ensure the region's cultural, economic, and political autonomy.</p>
            <p>Through decades of agitations, protests, and electoral politics, the JMM became the undisputed political voice of the statehood movement. The party's relentless efforts, led by the charismatic "Guruji" Shibu Soren, were instrumental in mobilizing public opinion and pressuring the central government. The formation of Jharkhand in 2000 was a direct result of the political struggle spearheaded by the JMM, cementing its place as the most influential political force in the state's history.</p>
