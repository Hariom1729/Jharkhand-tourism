            <p>The creation of Jharkhand was not a sudden political decision but the culmination of a struggle that lasted for over half a century. The demand for a separate state was rooted in the unique cultural identity, language, and historical grievances of the tribal communities of the Chotanagpur Plateau and Santhal Parganas regions of South Bihar.</p>
            <p>The movement gained political momentum in the 1950s with the formation of the Jharkhand Party, led by Jaipal Singh Munda, which argued that the mineral-rich region was being economically exploited and its indigenous culture neglected. Over the decades, the movement saw numerous agitations, protests, and political negotiations.</p>
            <p>The final push came in the 1990s, led by parties like the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM). In August 2000, the Indian Parliament passed the Bihar Reorganisation Act. On November 15, 2000—the birth anniversary of the revered tribal hero Birsa Munda—Jharkhand was born as the 28th state of India, marking a historic moment of recognition and self-determination for its people.</p>
