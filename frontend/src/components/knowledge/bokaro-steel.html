            <p>In the post-independence era, India embarked on a mission of rapid industrialization to build a self-reliant nation. A key part of this vision was the establishment of large-scale public sector industries, and the Bokaro Steel Plant stands as a monumental example of this ambition. Incorporated in 1964, it was conceived as the fourth public sector steel plant in the country.</p>
            <p>The plant was established with significant technical and financial collaboration from the Soviet Union, a hallmark of Indo-Soviet relations during that period. It was designed to be India's first indigenous steel plant, using Indian equipment and raw materials to the greatest extent possible. The construction of the massive plant led to the development of Bokaro Steel City, a planned township to house its thousands of employees.</p>
            <p>Today, the Bokaro Steel Plant is operated by the Steel Authority of India (SAIL) and remains one of the largest steel producers in the country. It is a symbol of India's industrial prowess and a testament to the vision of building a modern, industrialized nation from the ground up, right in the heart of Jharkhand's mineral-rich landscape.</p>
