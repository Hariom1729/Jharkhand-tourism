            <p>The cuisine of Jharkhand is a reflection of its land: rustic, earthy, and deeply nourishing. It's characterized by the use of fresh, locally sourced ingredients, including a wide variety of leafy greens (saag), millets, and forest produce. The cooking methods are often simple, with less emphasis on heavy spices and more on preserving the natural flavors of the ingredients.</p>
            <p>One of the most iconic dishes is **Dhuska**, a deep-fried snack made from a fermented batter of rice and lentils, commonly enjoyed for breakfast with a spicy chickpea curry called ghugni. Another beloved staple is **Litti Chokha**, whole wheat balls stuffed with spiced sattu (roasted gram flour) that are roasted over a fire and served with mashed vegetables. During the monsoon, a special delicacy called **Rugra**, a type of edible mushroom found in the Sal forests, is highly sought after.</p>
            <p>No culinary journey through Jharkhand is complete without trying **Thekua**, a hard, sweet cookie made from wheat flour and jaggery, which is a traditional offering during the Chhath Puja festival. The food of Jharkhand offers a unique taste of the region's tribal culture and its profound connection to the natural bounty of the land.</p>
