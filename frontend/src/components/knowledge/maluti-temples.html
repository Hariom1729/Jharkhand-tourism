            <p>Nestled in the Dumka district of Jharkhand lies the extraordinary village of Maluti, an archaeological and cultural treasure. At first glance, it appears to be a humble village, but it is home to a dense cluster of ancient terracotta temples that are unique in their architectural style and historical significance.</p>
            <p>The temples were built between the 17th and 19th centuries under the patronage of the Baj Basanta dynasty. Instead of constructing grand palaces, the devout rulers channeled their resources into building temples. Originally, there were 108 temples—a number considered sacred in Hinduism—but today, around 72 of them survive in varying states of preservation.</p>
            <p>The temples are renowned for their intricate terracotta panels, which depict vivid scenes from Hindu epics like the Ramayana and Mahabharata, as well as the life of the goddess Durga. The unique "Chala" style of Bengali architecture and the detailed artistry make Maluti a hidden gem, offering a glimpse into the rich cultural and religious history of the region.</p>
