            <p>The Santhal Rebellion, or **Santhal Hul**, of 1855-56 was one of the most powerful and organized tribal uprisings in Indian history, predating the more famous Sepoy Mutiny of 1857. This was not just a protest but a full-scale war for independence waged by the Santhal tribe against the oppressive system of the British East India Company and their local agents.</p>
            <p>The root cause of the rebellion was the ruthless economic exploitation of the Santhals by zamindars (landlords) and mahajans (moneylenders). The Santhals were subjected to exorbitant taxes, trapped in inescapable debt, and their ancestral lands were systematically seized. Their traditional systems of justice were ignored, leaving them with no recourse.</p>
            <p>The rebellion was led by four brothers—**Sidhu, Kanhu, Chand, and Bhairav Murmu**—who claimed to have received a divine message to overthrow the rule of outsiders and establish their own sovereign state. They mobilized over 10,000 Santhals armed with bows and arrows, and for a time, they successfully took control of a vast area. Although the rebellion was eventually crushed with extreme brutality by the British military, its impact was significant. It forced the colonial administration to create the **Santhal Parganas**, a separate district with special laws designed to protect the Santhals from exploitation.</p>
